# PRESENTATION


The idea for this project was learn more about ApiRest, Json and Python to improve my skills in those subjects, this is a simple HangMan Game, it has 4 categories to play in spanish or english if you select the option to play on local, those are: Animals, Fellings, Countries, Food. If you select API, you only could play in spanish and with just one category by the moment which is Animals.

The project has a lot to improve, any suggestion is welcome


> note: if you dont have internet connection not select the API mode it will crash

## API used 

I used a API for random words, this API is for public use, i leave the link below
